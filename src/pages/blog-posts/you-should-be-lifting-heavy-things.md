Heavy lifting is most associated with bodybuilding and powerlifters.
The image of shiny oiled human specimens with massive muscles and zero body fat paired with injury horror stories lead many people to turn away from the barbell.

First, let's clarify what 


Okay, now that we're past that hump.
Why lift at all though?

Margin of error. It's the reason everyone should lift (if they can and you probably can) in addition to whatever other goals they have.

"Strong people are harder to kill" -- Mark Rippetoe?

Or injure, break, accidentally or purposely in any way. 

The more you're able to deadlift, the more confident you'll be that lifting that couch isn't going to throw out your back.


But Johnnnnn you cry. Isn't heavy lifing prone to injury?
I would rather my chances of injury revolve around a specific focused time of training than any random point in life.
I don't want to throw out my shoulder some day by just tossing a beer.
I don't want to injure my ankle by unexpectedly stepping on a curb with just my toes.
