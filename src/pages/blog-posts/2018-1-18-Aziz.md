Since Aziz has built much of his career around being a good ally, I would expect him to be very familiar with non-verbal communication.
That he "misinterpreted" the situation is disappointing and suspicious.

Being asked to listen to non-verbal cues is not the same as being asked to read minds. 
Pushing or pulling away is "No". Hesitation is not "Yes!". Removing your hand from a location repeatedly means "Don't put your hand there" not "Isn't this a fun game?". "Can we slow down?" means the speed limit has changed until otherwise notified, not just a speed bump.

If you want those kinds of interactions consensually, you had better talk about it explicitly before hand and I would expect Aziz to know that.
