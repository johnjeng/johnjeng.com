This year, my goals come down to 3 primary projects and 3 secondary lifestyle changes.

## Projects
1. Dance training
2. Build useful software
3. Fitness training

## Lifestyle Changes
1. Follow my budget
2. Eat healthy
3. Bloggarino

# Dance Training
During my entire time learning Lindy Hop and other dances, I've never managed to have a regimented training process to improve consistently.
I've always practiced in small bursts.
This year I'm going to do at least some practice every day even if it's just body scanning for 5 minutes.
The idea is to get into the habit so that I can ramp up over the year.

Additionally, I plan to practice regularly at least twice a week with a partner where we practice idea generation (choreography) and refining movement. 
Every new idea and every intentional change to a shape will be considered good progress.

# Building Software
Building things has taken a back-burner in my spare time.
My goal is to create two things this year that have legit users who depend on the software.
The idea is that they should be useful enough to monetize.
Project #1 is already underway and if you have ideas for project #2, shoot me a message!
Preferably it would be something that solves a problem of yours.

# Fitness Training
Every time I've done Starting Strength, life priorities intervened before reaching an intermediate stage.
This year I'm planning to reach that stage and then train my cardio enough to run 2 miles in 12 minutes again.
