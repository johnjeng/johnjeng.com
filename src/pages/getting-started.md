My training system is about creating a sustainably adaptive fitness practice for you to achieve any current and future goals. Gain the confidence to experiment safely with your routine and find what works best for you. Training with me isn't about following the latest fad fitness trend or trying to be someone else. It's about you.

If you're interested in this kind of close attentive training, [email](mailto:john.jeng5@gmail.com) me or
