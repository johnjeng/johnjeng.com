Hi, I'm John, a human with many interests, hobbies, passions, and values. 

### Some stuff about me
- I've been coaching people since 2011
- I help make and run [Cocalc](https://cocalc.com)!
- You can catch me climbing at SBP or Lindy Hopping around Seattle
- My favorite board games are deck builders. Dominion or Magic anyone?
- I'm a [onebagger](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag) when I travel. Even if it's months long.
